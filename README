This is a collection of really old and miscellaneous projects that I originally
maintained under Google Project Hosting (code.google.com).  Don't pay attention
to the copyleft notices in some of the files: If any of this is found to be
useful, I'll gladly re-distribute under Unlicense (see: unlicense.org).

As usual, I had no idea what I was doing when I wrote this code, so please keep
an eye out for sharp pointy things that may cause you irreparable harm.
