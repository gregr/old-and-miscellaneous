This python program will generate a prolog program which will solve the puzzle you provide.

You'll need to install python and SWI-Prolog:
http://www.python.org
http://www.swi-prolog.org

Different prolog implementations don't seem to come with the same standard libraries, so I'm not sure if a different prolog would be able to run the generated programs.

To solve the example puzzle, first run the python program:

	python makesudokusolver.py puzzles/example.txt

You should then be able to double-click the generated file 'puzzles/example.pl' which will automatically run prolog and print out the solution.
